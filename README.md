# Postman Basics

Postman is one of the most popular software testing tools which is used for API testing. With the help of this tool, developers can easily create, test, share, and document APIs.


# Introduction to Postman
- Postman is a standalone software testing API (Application Programming Interface) platform to build, test, design, modify, and document APIs. It is a simple Graphic User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requests and responses.

- While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write any HTTP client network code. Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact with the API.

- In this tool, nearly any functionality that any developer may need is embedded. This tool has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and convert the API to code for languages like JavaScript and Python.



# Terms Used in Postman 
- API
Application Programming Interface (API) is software that acts as an intermediary for two apps to communicate with each other. We use APIs whenever we use an application like Twitter, Facebook, sending text messages, or checking the weather over the phone.

- HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the collection of rules for the transmission of data on the World Wide Web, like graphic images, text, video, sound, and other multimedia data. The Web users implicitly make use of HTTP as soon as they open their Web browser.

Example: A user or browser enters the HTTP request to the server; the server then returns the user response. This response includes the request status information and may consist of the requested material as well.

The most commonly used HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, DELETE, and OPTIONS.

- Step-2: For downloading the app for Windows, click on the download button and select the particular version. 

- Step-3: Check the download progress on the bottom left if using the Chrome browser. Once the .exe file is downloaded, install the application.

- Step-4: Once the installation completes, it redirected to a window as shown in the image below where it can be clicked for Stop signing in and take straight to the app (as this app can also be used without logging in) otherwise a new window opens up to sign up.

- Step-5: Create your account

- Step-6: After signing in, select the workspace tools as per your requirement, and then click on, continue to get the startup screen.

You're all set!!


# API Testing and Unit Testing 

Unit testing is done by the Developers or by Test Engineers and is done on a class by class basis or on the single component level. A major emphasis is on the fact whether each unit or module works perfectly fine in isolation. 

API testing is basically black box testing which is simply concerned with the final output of the system under test. 
API testing primarily aims to test the business logic layer of the system's architecture. API testing is primarily handled by the QA team, which requires them to run any API on top of a particular build meant to serve a specific purpose.

API testing also tests the unit as part of a system, while unit testing typically tests the unit in relative isolation from the rest of the system.
